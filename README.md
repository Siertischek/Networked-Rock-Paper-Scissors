# Networked-Rock-Paper-Scissors
A networked version of Rock Paper Scissors written in Python

Running the program:
1. Have the programs in the same folder (shouldn't really matter but that is what I have and did)
2. Have Python downloaded
3. Have the command prompt open in three instances
4. Run the commands for server first and then clients with the settings that you want such as port number and Human (0) or Computer (1) (python server.py 4000 and python client.py 4000 0)
5. Play Rock, Paper, Scissors
6. Success! You have run my Rock, Paper, Scissor networking project
